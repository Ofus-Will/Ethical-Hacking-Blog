            <h2 id="intro">Understanding Personal and Sensitive Data</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered what personal data and sensitive data are? Personal data is information that can
                identify an individual, such as their name, ID number, age, and address. On the other hand, sensitive
                data is personal information that is more private and intimate. </p>
            <p>This information should be kept
                confidential and only accessible to those who have permission to do so. Unlike personal data, the
                mismanagement of sensitive data can result in discrimination or direct harm to a person's reputation and
                well-being.</p>
            <h2 id="attacks">How Cyberattacks Can Expose Sensitive Data</h2>
            <p>Cyberattacks can expose sensitive data, and there are various types of cyberattacks. Phishing is one of
                the most common types of attacks, which involves tricking the recipient into providing personal
                information through fake emails or websites.</p>
            <p>Malware, such as viruses and trojans, is malicious software
                that can be installed on your computer without your knowledge. Social engineering involves psychological
                manipulation to get confidential information from you, and brute force attacks try every possible
                password combination until the right one is found. Software vulnerabilities in programs can also be
                exploited by attackers to gain access to private data.</p>

            <h2 id="protection">Protecting Yourself From Data Exposure</h2>
            <p>As technology advances, our personal data and systems are increasingly at risk of being compromised by
                malicious computer threats. However, there are steps we can take to safeguard ourselves from these
                attacks.</p>

            <p> Firstly, it's important to exercise caution when receiving and opening emails. Always verify the
                sender's identity and be wary of clicking on any links or giving out sensitive information. Using
                reliable antivirus software can also help to detect and block dangerous emails.</p>

            <p>Keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security updates is also
                essential in preventing malware from infiltrating your device. It's best to avoid downloading or opening
                files from unknown or suspicious sources to minimize the risk of exposure.</p>

            <p>Social engineering tactics are also commonly used by cybercriminals to trick people into divulging
                confidential information. Be wary of unexpected requests for sensitive information and never give out
                personal details over the phone or by email. Additionally, using strong and frequently changed
                passwords, as well as enabling multi-factor authentication, can help to prevent brute force attacks.</p>

            <p>Lastly, it's crucial to keep all software up to date and apply necessary security patches to minimise
                vulnerabilities. Always download software from reputable sources and avoid pirated or untrusted
                websites.</p>

            <p>Overall, protecting we from computer threats is an ongoing effort that requires a combination of
                technological solutions, user education, and awareness. By taking these steps, we can minimise our
                vulnerability to data exposure and keep our systems and personal information safe.</p>
