            <h2 id="intro">What is GDPR anyways?</h2>
            <p>
                GDPR is something that's thrown out a lot these days, especially in online spaces. You may know the 
                term GDPR because it's one of the major factors in why those cookie menus appear every time you visit 
                a new website. It's also the reason as to why if you have an account on a website or application, 
                you can request all the data associated with the account and delete relevant data, whether it is just 
                a portion of data or everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                GDPR, or the <b>G</b>eneral <b>D</b>ata <b>P</b>rotection <b>R</b>egulation, was something that is put 
                into place by the European Union to protect the privacy and personal information 
                of the citizens in the EU. The regulation was implemented in May of 2018 and has since become the gold 
                standard in terms of data privacy. GDPR is something that should apply everywhere regardless of where you are, 
                as long you are an EU citizen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, it's made to protect the privacy of you and I everywhere online.
            </p>
            <h2 id="attacks">What does GDPR consider personal data?</h2>
            <p>
                The GDPR definition for personal data is very broad. The very open definition is written in a certain way 
                so that the GDPR can cover all forms of personal information, regardless of what they are and the time 
                they are made.
            </p>
            <div class="container d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
                <img src="gdpr2.png" alt="Personal data defintion from GDPR" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                The image above shows how the GDPR defines personal data. As mentioned before, the definition is 
                incredibly non-specific, meaning that every piece of personal data that you process or store will 
                likely to fall under the definition. Some examples of what is considered personal data is shown as 
                a baseline, but the way the definition is written definitely goes beyond the examples. Something 
                that many may not think of is pseudonymous data. Pseudonymous data may also apply if it is easy 
                to identify someone with.
                <br>
                This broad definition is honed in on a little further for 3 specific types of data. Genetic data,
                biometric data and data concerning health. The expanded definition is used to further future proof 
                GDPR a little more.
            </p>
            <div class="container d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
                <img src="gdpr3.png" alt="GDPR expanded definition of personal data" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Why is this relevant to sensitive data exposure?</h2>
            <p>
                Data exposure is rarely ever the fault of the user. Much of sensitive data exposure is caused due to hacking
                into databases. GDPR is in place to protect the users, and punish those who don't protect sensitive data 
                properly. The regulation states that an organisation 'by design and default' consider data protection 
                principles when designing any new product or activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                GDPR is a gold standard in data privacy meaning it also deals with how personal data is processed.
                The general rule of thumb is that personal data must never be stored unless it is for legitimate 
                purposes. The processor must then explicitly state what the purpose of storing the data and what they
                are doing with the data. The data subject must then agree to all these terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Business who handle personal data must take extreme care to ensure that they follow GDPR as 
                punishment for mishandling data, whether it be accidental (personal data leak or hacking) 
                or on purpose (storing data without consent to use for unethical practices) can be very high, 
                depending on how serious the violation is. People affected by the mishandling of personal 
                data also have the right to claim compensation as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this also could apply to an organisation outside the European Union as well. If the organisation 
                is based out side the EU but does process data on people within the EU, a representative of your organisation 
                must be appointed in an EU state which can communicate with data protection authorities within the EU.
                The organisation could also use a third party service to process the data on thier behalf, but they must be aware 
                that the service they choose must be reliable and has sufficient data protection guarantees.
            </p>
            <h2>What should happen after sensitive data exposure has happened?</h2>
            <p>
                When a data breach has occured in an organisation, the organisation must notify all involved data subjects
                within 72 hours or they must deal with immediate penalties. However, if appropriate safeguards are put into place 
                which can render the data unreadable, the organisation doesn't need to notify the involved parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, there are punishments for organisations which do have a data breach of some kind. There 
                are 2 tiers of fines which can be issues to an organisation. Tier 1 is for less severe infringements while tier 2 
                infringements are for the more serious violations of GDPR. The fines are issued by the data regulator in the 
                country that the organisation is based in. The data regualtor will decide which tier of fine you will be issued 
                based on 10 criteria.
            </p>
            <div class="container d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
                <img src="gdpr4.png" alt="Data regulator punishment criteria" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                These 10 criteria and then evaluated against several of the GDPR articles, and depending on how many articles 
                you have violated as well as the severity, fines will then be issued.
                <br>
                Tier 1 fines can be up to €10 million, or 2% of the firm's worldwide annual revenue from the preceding 
                financial year, whichever amount is higher. Tier 2 fines are double this, a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of 
                the firm's worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher.
            </p>
            <h2>What about the UK?</h2>
            <p>
                With the extended proccess of brexit, GDPR was actually enforced in the UK until they were no longer a member state 
                of the European Union. As mentioned before, GDPR was implemented in May of 2018, while brexit was fully completed at 
                then end of 2020. At the start of 2021, the UK began to enforce their own version of the GDPR. If a UK organisation 
                does deal in any capacity within the EU, they still must comply with the EU GDPR however.
            </p>
            <p>
                The UK's version of the GDPR is actually quite similar to the EU's GDPR. Most of the wording has just been changed to fit 
                into the UK's laws and regulations. There are a few key differences though. for example, GDPR has been split into 
                2 seperate data protection laws. UK's own GDPR and the data protection act. The DPA affects organisations which use another 
                organisation to process data while the GDPR side extends it to affect the data processor organisation themselves. 
                Another change would be how GDPR is regulated. Since the UK is no longer a part of the EU, they must use their own regulators
                to decide what is considered breaking the DPA and GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2 changes mentioned here are just a drop in the ocean. For more information, you should do your own research and look into 
                more official sources which outline what the regulations and acts require to ensure that you are properly handling private data.
